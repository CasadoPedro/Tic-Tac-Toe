<h1>TIC TAC TOE GAME</h1>
</h3>This is a <em>Tic Tac Toe</em> game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. </h3>

The game allows the user to play against a computer opponent with adjustable difficulty settings. The game board is rendered in HTML, and JavaScript is used to handle the game logic and update the board as moves are made. The CSS file provides styling for the game board and game screen.

<h2>Game Difficulties</h2>
This **Tic Tac Toe** game offers three different difficulty levels to choose from: Easy, Hard, and Impossible. The difficulty level can be selected at the beginning of each game.

**Easy**: The computer player makes random moves and tries to win if it can.<br>
**Hard**: The computer player uses a simple algorithm to make its moves and can block the player's attempts to win.<br>
**Impossible**: The computer player uses a more advanced algorithm to make its moves and reacts to each player move. (There is a way to beat it, good luck finding it!)<br>

The purpose of the project was to use the Module pattern to build and design objects to incorporate game logic.
